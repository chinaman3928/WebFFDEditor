					I want to help demystify the inner workings of the game, contribute to the playerbase’s collective knowledge, give players more freedom to experiment and test and play as they want. But I hope this website's use continues beyond that, extending also as inspiration for others wanting to work more generally with lower level under-the-hood mechanics and implementations, anyone interested in game source code, save files, and the series’ specific implementation decisions. I'm glad to take some of the first steps [credits] in making it more accessible and understandable, and showing just a bit of what's possible with the source code released.

					For greater access to uncovering the games' inner workings and knowledge about binary files, save file formats, and software!
